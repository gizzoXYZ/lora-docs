### How to program the M4 without the Arduino abstraction?

From http://www.udoo.org/forum/threads/how-to-program-the-m4-without-the-arduino-abstraction.4210

>> As the title say, How to program the m4 without the arduino abstraction?
>
> One way is to use [FreeRTOS](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/arm-processors/i.mx-applications-processors/i.mx-6-processors/i.mx6qp/i.mx-6-series-software-and-development-tool-resources:IMX6_SW); Download the zip and look for the documentation.

>> What is the .fw format?
>
> Binary currently is the current method; need to use udooneo-m4uploader copy binary into memory and start the M4.

>> I know .fw is some sort of binary and i can use udooneo-m4uploader to upload it, but how to generate it? Is .fw a renamed .bin? a renamed .elf? Absolutely no documentation at all on the m4 coprocessor for udoo.

> It is binary, just rename.
